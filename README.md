pyNotmuchFS
===========

pyNotmuchFS is a virtual Maildir++ file system for Notmuch queries written in Python. It intends to bridge the gap between Notmuch and common (remote) mail access methods such as IMAP.

pyNotmuchFS is heavily inspired by [notmuchfs](https://github.com/tsto/notmuchfs) created by Tim Stoakes. It is thought that a Python version of notmuchfs enables more people to experiment with their ideal filesystem API to Notmuch.

For more information, please take a look at the [design document](DESIGN.md).
